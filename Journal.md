So I made alot of progress today. I started brainstorming and made the schematic and wired the pcb.

I also didnt know the height of normal mx switches and the height of the tft screen, as it comes with headers which is good as I dont want it to be alot lower then the switches.
After figuring this out I basically started making the case, though I had alot of problems figuring out how to set it up. So I didnt know where to put the screw holes, the size of the screen and ect..

I didnt get to design the top or the firmware yet.
