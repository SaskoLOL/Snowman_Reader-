So I made alot of progress today. I started brainstorming and made the schematic and wired the pcb.

I also didnt know the height of normal mx switches and the height of the tft screen, as it comes with headers which is good as I dont want it to be alot lower then the switches.
After figuring this out I basically started making the case, though I had alot of problems figuring out how to set it up. So I didnt know where to put the screw holes, the size of the screen and ect..

I didnt get to design the top or the firmware yet.

Today I finished my project, finally, I sadly had alot problems with fusion again, I first forgot to make the top a new component, so I had to redo it whole. Then I couldnt get the screw holes right, and finally when I finished I forgot to add a hole for the usb, thankfully I did that and finished the CAD.

As you see I let a little bit more room for the screen as printing often isnt as precise and then the space for the screen to go trought wouldnt be big enough. 
After that I finished the firmware for showing the words and using the buttons to turn the pages.
Session time: 6 hours

Time took to complete the project: 15 hours
