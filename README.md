# Snowman_Reader
This uses a tft 320x240 screen and two mx switches that go with it. As a microcontroller it uses a seed xiao rp2040. What it does is that you can upload some text, and it will show you a set number of words per "page" and you can use the two buttons to navigate trough the pages.
# PCB
The schematic is a simple layout using a screen and two buttons.

The PCB has simple wiring and the microcontroller is placed between the buttons to save as much space as possible and this way it looks the best.

# CAD
The cad consists of simple two layers, the bottom case and the top case. The top case leaves the switches and the rp2040 exposed on pupouse, and just covers the rest of the screen.

As you see both the bottom case and the top case have holes for screws, thouse will be used to hold the two parts together.
